I really need to get this done... I want to use it but the only one I have working is the freelance version which has the wrong context/wording

Otherwise the freelancer journal app has been working great, contentEditable has been nice

drag photos in (need to add resize at some point)

I also was thinking about hosting the files locally/replacing the base64 with a hyperlink, it's not hard to do... but what I have is working...

just use a massive datatype lmao

I can't do this now. My free time has been devoted to this medical "startup" what makes a startup, a startup?

Does it have cash flow? Anyway working on it

But I will as my "for me/fun" project I will get this done/working on a separate instance/db

Damn it I got sick AGAIN!!!

Working in a place that has thousands of people... I guess it is bound to happen.

The issue is, you need to get a medical note to get a LOA/be able to afford it... or you lose your points and you get fired... yeah sucks to be poor.

Anyway I really like the freelancer-journal interface... it's content editable and it has drag-drop image support (like a blog editor)

The code was written with "freelancer/client" terms unfortunately so I have to strip all of that out
