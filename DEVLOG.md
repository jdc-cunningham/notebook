Damn it I got sick AGAIN!!!

Working in a place that has thousands of people... I guess it is bound to happen.

The issue is, you need to get a medical note to get a LOA/be able to afford it... or you lose your points and you get fired... yeah sucks to be poor.

Anyway I really like the freelancer-journal interface... it's content editable and it has drag-drop image support (like a blog editor)

The code was written with "freelancer/client" terms unfortunately so I have to strip all of that out
