### About

Cloned from [freelancer-journal](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/freelancer-journal)

This is yet another note-taking app... but it has tabs on the left sidebar...

Plus it has websocket support for communication between two separate instances eg. on two different computers

No multi-user support though just 1

### Note

This port was done poorly, just enough to get it to work, too many things to replace (from freelancer/client to note)

I will more than likely make another one of these, ultimately I want to unify all the data I've collected so the UIs will evolve over time, missing drawing component for example. One day when I'm not so broke I'll get a used Surface Book 3 and use that (drawing).

It's funny I had an SB2 before but I ended up selling it, same with SG1/2 so idk. I really did like my remarkable 2 though and while it is programmable (C or C++) I didn't try when I had it.
