### About

Cloned from [freelancer-journal](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/freelancer-journal)

This is yet another note-taking app... but it has tabs on the left sidebar...

Plus it has websocket support for communication between two separate instances eg. on two different computers

No multi-user support though just 1
